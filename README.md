# Homework 01

Herein lies the contents for the first homework assignment. Each problem in the PDF has a corresponding template markdown file in the repository. Please add your solutions to each problem in the provided template, and then upload it back to GitHub to submit it.

Problem 3 requires an existing table of heavy metal bands, which you can create and populate using the queries included in `metal_bands.sql`. You can either open the file in your client of choice and run both commands (making sure your desired database is selected), or drag and drop the file into BeeKeeper Studio to load the contents and then run the queries. Or you can always cut and paste in the needed commands.

You may need to wait until after class next week to answer Problem 4, unless you read ahead some about the other data types available.
