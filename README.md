Problem 4 requires an existing table of heavy metal bands, which you can create and populate using the queries included in `metal_bands.sql`. You can either open the file in VSCode and run both commands (making sure your desired database is selected), or drag and drop the file into BeeKeeper Studio to load the contents and then run the queries. Or you can always cut and paste in the needed commands.
